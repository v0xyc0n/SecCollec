# SecCollec

Collection of tools and ressources collected during daily operations 

This list is work in progress and will probably stay that way. It is in no way a comprehensive list, because it omits most basic tools and vulnerabilities, and instead focuses on specific topics I found worth noting down. As I am most interested in Web-Application security, most topics relate to that.

## Training

_Exploiting intentionally vulnerable systems in a gamified approach like CTF_

- [Portswigger Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security) - Very extensive list of Web Security Vulnerabilities, including labs; highly recommended
- [Hack The Box](https://app.hackthebox.com/) - Hack The Box is one of the biggest CTF platforms

## Bug Bounty

_Companies rewarding the reporting of vulnerabilities. (Be very caerful when Pentesting without Permission To Attack: Most of these companies define a very specific scope, activities out-of-scope can result in legal action!)_

- [FireBounty](https://firebounty.com/) - Very extensive collection 

## Collections

_Or collection [of collections]*_
